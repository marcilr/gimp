XCF, short for eXperimental Computing Facility,[1] is the native
image format of the GIMP image-editing program.  It saves all of
the data the program handles related to the image, including,
among others, each layer, the current selection, channels,
transparency, paths and guides.

XCF is a file extension for an image file native to GIMP.  XCF
stands for eXperimental Computing Facility.  Similar to a
Photoshop Document (PSD), XCF files support saving layers,
channels, transparency, paths and guides, yet don't support
saving the undo history.
